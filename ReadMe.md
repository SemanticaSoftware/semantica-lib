# Semantica.Lib repository

## Summary

Sources, tests and examples for the packages at https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Semantica.

Available from https://github.com/SemanticaSoftware/semantica-lib

Currently, the project is not building when retrieved from the github source repo. (Error : The value of 
SourceRoot.RepositoryUrl with identity 'C:\Repos\semantica-lib\' is invalid: 
'https://github.com/SemanticaSoftware/semantica-lib.git'). But the project will build normally outside of the github workspace.

Summaries, ReadMe.md's and additional documentation for each package are work in progress, as well as properly documented
example projects and full test coverage.

XmlDoc generated ReadMe's are currenly not valid markdown, because of a known issue in vsxmd (https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd/issues/85).

Any and all feedback is welcomed.
